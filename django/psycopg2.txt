psycopg2


having POSTGRESQL installed on your system and installing PSYCOPG2 
are two DIFFERENT things:

1. PostgreSQL (Database Server):
PostgreSQL is the DATABASE SERVER itself. It's the software that MANAGES DATABASES and HANDLES REQUESTS from clients 
(such as Django) to PERFORM OPERATIONS like CREATING, READING, UPDATING, OR DELIVERING DATA.
You interact with PostgreSQL via tools like psql, pgAdmin, or through your application (in this case, Django).
When you installed PostgreSQL, you likely installed the server itself along with the necessary management tools.

2. psycopg2 (Python Adapter):
psycopg2 is a PYTHON PACKAGE that allows your Django application to COMMUNICATE with the PostgreSQL server. 
It acts as a BRIDGE between Python code (Django) and PostgreSQL.
Even though PostgreSQL is installed on your system, Django needs psycopg2 to TRANSLATE the PYTHON CODE into SQL QUERIES and 
send them to the PostgreSQL server.

Why You Need psycopg2:
Django INTERACTS with databases using Database ADAPTERS.
For PostgreSQL, psycopg2 is the MOST COMMON and widely used ADAPTERthat Django relies on to INTERACT with the PostgreSQL database.
WITHOUT psycopg2, your Django project won't be able to connect to the PostgreSQL database, even though PostgreSQL is installed and running.

Summary:
PostgreSQL is the actual database server.
psycopg2 is the Python library that allows Django to talk to PostgreSQL.
So, youâ€™ll still need to install psycopg2 in your Python environment to let Django communicate with your already-installed PostgreSQL server.
