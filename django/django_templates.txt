Using Django Templates

By default, a Django project is configured to 
look for templates inside of a templates folder 
within each appâ€™s folder (main_app in this case).

therefore, creating a folder in the main_app folder
and naming it templates is necessary. 

create the templates using .html and include them into 
the views functions as necessary.

after the home page template is created, the routing in the main_app/urls.py 
for the following templates should be 'template_name/'. the forward slash
after is crucial in django.
