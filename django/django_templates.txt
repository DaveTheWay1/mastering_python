Using Django Templates

By default, a Django project is configured to 
look for templates inside of a templates folder 
within each appâ€™s folder (main_app in this case).

therefore, creating a folder in the main_app folder
and naming it templates is necessary. 

create the templates using .html and include them into 
the views functions as necessary.
