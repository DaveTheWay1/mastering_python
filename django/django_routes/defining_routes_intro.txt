Defining Routes (URLs)

Just like with Express, there needs to be a route defined that 
matches each HTTP request coming from the browser.

when there is no route defined that matches a given HTTP request
we get the error: 404 Not Found

But, let’s not forget that Django’s routing system only cares 
about the URL (path) of the request and ignores the HTTP method.

For the HOME page functionality, we’ll use the root 
route (http://localhost:8000)
