Defining View Functions

We define all of the appâ€™s views in main_app/views.py.
define the home view function and render a non-existing template:

from django.shortcuts import render

# Define the home view
def home(request):
  return render(request, 'home.html')

All view functions need to define a positional parameter to 
accept the request object Django will be passing in.

As expected, refreshing localhost:8000 will cause an error complaining 
that the template does not exist.
