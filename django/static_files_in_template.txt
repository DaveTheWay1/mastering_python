Including Static Files in a Template

Django projects are pre-configured with a 
'django.contrib.staticfiles' app installed for the 
purpose of serving static files.

At the bottom of settings.py, there is a STATIC_URL = 'static/' 
variable that declares the name of the folder 
that will contain static files within Django apps.

create in the main_app folder a folder called static.
within it, a css folder and within that create a style.css 
and write css like normal

on the template you wish to add the css;

{% load static %}

<!DOCTYPE html>

and add the css link:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{% static 'css/style.css' %}">
