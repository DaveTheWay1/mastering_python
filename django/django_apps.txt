A Django project contains Django APPS.

Django apps REPRESENT major FUNCTIONALITY in a project, 
although you would typically create only a SINGLE app within the project.

Take a look at the INSTALLED_APPS list in project_name_here/settings.py. 
Those PRE-INSTALLED apps PROVIDE services such as the ADMIN app and 
the ability to serve STATIC FILES.

When creating a django project, youll need to an app to implement the main
FUNCTIONALITY.
typically, these apps are named main_app. They are created using the command:
python3 manage.py startapp main_app
!! within your django project

after creating the main_app folder, you should include it within your installed 
apps like so:
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	'main_app',
	'django.contrib.admin',
	'django.contrib.auth',
	'django.contrib.contenttypes',
	'django.contrib.sessions',
	'django.contrib.messages',
	'django.contrib.staticfiles',
]

!!! DO NOT FORGET THE COMMA AFTER INCLUDING MAIN_APP !!!
