The quirky thing about Django is how it names 
its high-level components.

What we think of as a web application, 
Django calls a project.

Furthermore, what we think of as part of an appâ€™s 
functionality (or modules), Django refers to as apps.

A Django project can have many apps, and a Django app can belong to multiple projects.
