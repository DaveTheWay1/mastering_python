# * Purpose
# A list provides a container for zero or more items (elements in JS arrays).
# Lists can contain items of different types, including dictionaries and nested lists.

# * Lists have a class (type) of list.

# * Basic Syntax
# Like arrays in JS, a list can be created literally with a set of square brackets:
colors = ['red', 'green', 'blue']

# * The number of items in a list is returned using the built-in len() function:
len(colors)
# > 3

# * !! Features
# Lists are considered to be a sequence type in Python. 
# A sequence is a generic term used for an ordered collection. 
# Other sequence types in Python include strings and tuples.

# * Lists are mutable:
# Existing items within a list can be updated
# Items can be added to a list
# Items can be removed from a list
