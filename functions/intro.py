# * Python Function Syntax
def this_is_a_function(x):
    pass

# the pass is what we call stubbing it up.
# essentially, this saves the space if you dont have the code 
# you want there ready yet.

# ? what gets returned if we run the function without a return statement?
print(this_is_a_function('a'))
# output:
# None
