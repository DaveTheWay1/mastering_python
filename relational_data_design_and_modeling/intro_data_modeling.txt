Intro to Data Modeling

An important part of the planning process for an 
application is determining the data persistence 
needs of that application.

This planning results in a *** DATA MODEL.

*** The DATA MODEL is conceptual and is used as a 
blueprint for implementing the data persistence needs 
within a given database technology (SQL, NoSQL, etc.).

The data model is typically visualized with 
an *** ENTITY RELATIONSHIP DIAGRAM (ERD).
