!! Distinguishing Between Attributes and Entities !!
    
If you answer “yes” to either of the following questions, the attribute is 
likely a candidate to be an entity instead:

Would the attribute likely have attributes of its own?
Could the attribute be in common with other entities? For example, 
a Customer for a Ticket is also likely to be common to other 
entities like Order, MarketingCampaign, Review, etc.
