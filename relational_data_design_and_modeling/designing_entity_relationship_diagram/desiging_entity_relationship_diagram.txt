Designing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

SAMPLE APPLICATION:

ERD for a Concert Ticket Tracking application

The application should track:
- The tickets for a concert
- The seat and price of the ticket
- The customer that bought a ticket
- The date of the concert
- The performer(s) of the concert
- The venue of the concert

The Process
Reviewing an application’s user stories is a good 
first step to creating the conceptual data model.

To design a basic ERD, we must identify 
three different components:
1. The data entities
2. The attributes (the data properties of an entity)
3. The relationships between the entities

et’s start with a preliminary Ticket entity…

The Ticket Entity

our first attempt at modeling the Ticket entity 
by including all the attributes you might see 
printed on a ticket:

    Ticket
    seat
    price
    event_date
    performer
    venue
    customer_name

    in a database, it might look like:

    tickets(database table)
    id      seat            price   event_date  performer   venue       customer_name
    1024    Row A Seat 25   250.0   12/14/2018  Alice       Microsoft   David
    another row with consistent data types 
    another row with consistent data types
    another row with consistent data types

    !!!!  However, several of the attributes in our first attempt are actually 
    better defined as entities instead !!!!!!

    !! Distinguishing Between Attributes and Entities !!
    
    If you answer “yes” to either of the following questions, the attribute is 
    likely a candidate to be an entity instead:

    Would the attribute likely have attributes of its own?
    Could the attribute be in common with other entities? For example, 
    a Customer for a Ticket is also likely to be common to other 
    entities like Order, MarketingCampaign, Review, etc.
