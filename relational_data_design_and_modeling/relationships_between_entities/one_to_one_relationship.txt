One-To-One Relationship

A one-to-one relationship exists when one row in a table 
relates to a single row in another table.

1:1 relationships are not as common as 1:M and M:M

For example:

A business has one mailing address and vice-versa:

Mailing             business
id                  id
street              name
city         -----|- mailling_address_id(FK)
state        |  
zip -|--------
