Mapping Between an Entity and a Relational Database

Remember, the conceptual data model is used as a blueprint 
for how the actual database will be structured.

Each entity in a data model identifies a table in 
a relational database. For example, a Book entity will 
result in a books table in the database.

Each row in the table would represent an instance of the entity.
