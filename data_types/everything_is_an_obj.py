# * Python is a very object-oriented language.
# In fact, pretty much everything in Python is an object thatâ€™s 
# been instantiated (created) by a particular class.

# * Checking the Data Type (class) of an Object
# We use the type() function to obtain the class used to instantiate the data:

type(42)
# <class 'int'>
type('hello')
# <class 'str'>
type(True)
# <class 'bool'>
