# * Boolean Values
# Python has two logical boolean values: True and False.

# * Truthy & Falsy in Python
# every expression in Python is considered to be either truthy or falsy.

# * Conditional expressions for if statements, etc., rely on an expression 
# evaluating to True/truthy or False/falsy to determine which path the code will follow.
# in Python are considered to be truthy.

# * Hereâ€™s what is falsy in Python:

# False
# None
# Zero in any numeric type: 0, 0.0 and 0j
# Empty sequences or collections:
# '' (empty string)
# [] (empty list)
# () (empty tuple)
# {} (empty dictionary)
# range(0) (empty range)
# ðŸ‘€ [] and {} in JavaScript are truthy, not falsy as in Python.
