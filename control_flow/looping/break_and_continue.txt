The break and continue Statements

The break statement: 
    used to immediately exit for and while loops 
    and continue executing any statements that may follow them.


The continue statement: 
    used to immediately return to the top of 
    the for or while loop. In the case of a while loop, its conditional expression is once 
    again evaluated to determine if the loop should continue.
